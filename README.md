<h3>Hyper Island Project</h3>

<strong>Brief:</strong> Group project to create a 2D game using the Phaser library

<strong>Timeframe:</strong> Three weeks.

<strong>Description:</strong> This is a top down 2D game where you play as a wizzard shooting enemies. There is both a single player mode with a highscore function* and a two player mode where two players can play on the same computer. This game is also deployed on netlify: https://hi-game-project-fsm.netlify.app/


<strong>Key learnings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Working with the Phaser library</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Import/Export in JavaScript</li>
 <li>Debugging</li>
 </ul>

 <h5>*the Firebase account has expired so the highscore is no longer supported</h5>
 
 <em>Side note: I did all the graphics in the game, including the sprite animation for both the players and the enemies. (I did not create the landing page picture) </em>
